### Code Explanation:

1. **Package Declaration**:
   - The class is declared within the `in.co.sunrays.net` package, which groups related classes together.

2. **Imports**:
   - The necessary classes from `java.io` and `java.net` are imported to handle input/output operations and network communications.

3. **JavaDoc Comments**:
   - A class-level comment is provided to describe the purpose of the `QuoteClient` class, including its functionality and copyright information.

4. **Main Method**:
   - The entry point of the program. It can throw an `IOException`, which indicates any input/output errors that may occur during the socket communication.

5. **Creating a DatagramSocket**:
   - `DatagramSocket socket = new DatagramSocket();`: A new UDP socket is created, allowing the client to send and receive packets.

6. **Buffer Creation**:
   - `byte[] buf = new byte[256];`: A byte array buffer is created to hold the data being sent and received. This buffer size can be adjusted as needed.

7. **Server Address**:
   - `InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.1");`: This line retrieves the IP address of the server (in this case, localhost).

8. **DatagramPacket Creation**:
   - `DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length, address, 4445);`: A new packet is created that encapsulates the buffer, server address, and the port number (4445) where the server is listening.

9. **Sending the Packet**:
   - `socket.send(packet);`: The packet is sent to the server. This triggers the server to respond with the quote.

10. **Receiving Response**:
    - A new `DatagramPacket` is created to receive the server's response.
    - `socket.receive(packet);`: The client waits for the server's response, which is stored in the packet.

11. **Data Conversion**:
    - `String received = new String(packet.getData(), 0, packet.getLength());`: The received data is converted from bytes to a string. The `getLength()` method is used to obtain the actual length of the data received to avoid trailing whitespace.

12. **Output the Response**:
    - The quote received from the server is printed to the console.

13. **Closing the Socket**:
    - Finally, `socket.close();` closes the socket, freeing up the resources.

### Summary:
The `QuoteClient` class demonstrates how to implement a simple UDP client in Java that sends a request for the quote of the day to a server and displays the response. It highlights key UDP operations, such as creating a socket, sending and receiving packets, and converting data formats.
