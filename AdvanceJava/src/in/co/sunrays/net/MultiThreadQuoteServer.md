### Explanation of the Code

1. **Package Declaration**:
   - The `package in.co.sunrays.net;` statement declares the package for organizing related classes.

2. **Imports**:
   - `import java.io.*;` imports all classes from the `java.io` package, which are likely needed for input and output operations.

3. **JavaDoc Comments**:
   - The class is documented with JavaDoc comments that explain its purpose, version, author, and related classes. This helps other developers understand the functionality and context of the class.

4. **Main Class**:
   - The class `MultiThreadQuoteServer` serves as the main entry point for the server application.

5. **Main Method**:
   - The `main` method is the starting point of the program. It creates a new instance of `QuoteServerThread` and starts it. 
   - This allows the server to begin handling client requests in a separate thread, which is essential for a multi-threaded server architecture.

6. **Exception Handling**:
   - The `main` method declares that it may throw an `IOException`, which is a checked exception that may occur during I/O operations. This ensures that any issues during server startup can be properly handled or reported.

### Next Steps
To make this server functional, you would typically implement the `QuoteServerThread` class, which would contain the logic to handle client connections and provide quotes or responses as needed. This class would manage the communication between the server and multiple clients using threads.
