### Explanation of the Code
1. **Server Initialization**:
   - The server is set up using `ServerSocket` on port `1234`, which waits for incoming client connections. It displays a message to indicate that it is waiting for a client.

2. **Client Connection Handling**:
   - The method `server.accept()` blocks until a client attempts to connect, and then it creates a `Socket` object representing the connection to the client.

3. **Data Stream Setup**:
   - `DataInputStream` and `DataOutputStream` are used to manage the input and output between the server and the client. These streams handle reading data from and writing data to the client.

4. **Message Exchange**:
   - The server reads a message from the client using `in.readLine()` and displays the message on the console. It then sends a greeting response back to the client using `out.writeBytes()`.

5. **Closing Connections**:
   - The connection to the client and the server socket is closed gracefully to free up system resources and prevent port blocking.

6. **Exception Handling**:
   - The `try-catch` block is used to handle `IOException` in case of any issues during network communication, such as connection failures or data transfer errors. The error is logged using `e.printStackTrace()` to help identify the issue.
