### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Package and Imports:**
   - The code is part of the package `in.co.sunrays.net`.
   - It imports necessary Java classes for networking (`java.net`), reading input (`java.util.Scanner`), and writing output (`java.io`).

2. **Class Description (`URLWriter`):**
   - The `URLWriter` class demonstrates how to send a parameter to a specified URL and read the response.
   - It establishes a connection to a specified URL (`http://www.ask.com/web`), sends a query parameter (`q=java`), and retrieves the resulting HTML content.

3. **Main Method:**
   - The `main` method serves as the entry point of the program.
   - It establishes a connection to a given URL, sends a query parameter, and reads the response from the server.

4. **URL Creation:**
   - A `URL` object is created using the specified URL (`http://www.ask.com/web`).
   - The `question` parameter is defined as `"java"` which will be sent as part of the request.

5. **URLConnection Setup:**
   - A `URLConnection` object is created to facilitate interaction with the specified URL.
   - The method `setDoOutput(true)` enables the URL connection to send output (i.e., data) to the server.

6. **Sending Data:**
   - An `OutputStreamWriter` is opened to write data to the server.
   - The query parameter is written to the output stream (`out.write("q=" + question)`).
   - The output stream is closed after sending the parameter.

7. **Connecting to the Server:**
   - The `connect()` method is called to establish the connection to the server.

8. **Reading the Response:**
   - An input stream is opened to read the response data from the server.
   - A `Scanner` is created to convert bytes from the input stream into readable text.
   - The program indicates the start of URL content output and reads the response line by line, printing it to the console.

9. **Closing Resources:**
   - After reading the response, the `Scanner` is closed to free up system resources.

This program effectively demonstrates how to send parameters to a web service and handle the response using Java's networking capabilities, making it a valuable example for understanding URL connections and data handling.
