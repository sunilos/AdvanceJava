  - `ConnectToMSAccessDB.java`  

- **Basic Operations**  
  - `GetRecord.java`  
  - `InsertRecord.java`  
  - `InsertRecordWithTx.java`  

- **Schema Management**  
  - `CreateTable.java`  
  - `AlterTable.java`  
  - `DropTable.java`  

- **Advanced Features**  
  - `GetMetaData.java`  
  - `CallStoredFunction.java`  
  - `CallStoredProcedure.java`  

- **Configuration-based Connection**  
  - `system.properties`  
  - `TestDBWithProperties.java`  

- **Service Layer Example**  
  - `MarksheetService.java`  
  - `TestMarksheetService.java`
